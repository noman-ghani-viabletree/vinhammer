<p>	- Fixed validation errors on certain multi-page forms.<br />

<strong>New:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic Relisting: This feature will enable auctioneers to relist their auctions automatically based on conditions they choose like
<ul>
<li>If Winner has not paid</li>
<li>If Auction expired without bids</li>
<li>If Reserve Price was not met</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Variable Increment: This feature will allow auctioneers to mention different incremental value for different bid amounts.

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Anti-Sniping/Soft Close: We have added two options for this feature. One option will recursively extend expiration time if bids are placed during a specific time interval. Second option will extend expiration only once and will send email to all bidders intimating this extension. Admin can now choose what behavior they want.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Add Auction Product form now has options to choose bidding, buy now or both.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple checkout option for users: If any user has won multiple auction products, he/she had to individually click "Pay Now" link under their My Accounts &gt; Auctions &gt; Won Bids to checkout that product and pay.

<p>Buy now can be disabled if user enters ZERO value for it.</p>
<p>3. Fix:</p>
